            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>
              Our community originated from the concerns and challenges students encounter when choosing a career path after high school or the 10th standard. By providing proper guidance during these times, we can help cultivate a workforce that enjoys their job. At the very least, we can prevent someone from pursuing the wrong degree and dispel confusion and misconceptions related to various degrees or fields.

        <div className="about-content">
          <p>
            Ever since finishing school, a pivotal question hangs in the air: "What do you want to be?" We answer with aspirations ‚Äì doctor, engineer, entrepreneur ‚Äì the possibilities are endless. The word "to be" takes center stage, shaping our path and affirming our identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our daily lives, we often use "yeah" or "yaa" to confirm and solidify something. "Oh yeah, that's it!" or a simple "Yeah" signifies agreement and validates our choices.
          </p>
          <p>
            2ByaaG takes these elements and merges them into a powerful message: "to bee yaa" (to be you). It's a constant reminder of your potential to become the person you envision. Our community serves as a platform to reaffirm this aspiration, providing the support, guidance, and resources you need to turn your "to be" into a resounding "I am."
